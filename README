Tools for sniffing and generating messages of simple distance-vector protocols
Part of the subject ISA (BUT, 2018/19)
Author: Jakub Zárybnický


This goal of this project is to create three executables, myripsniffer, myripresponse, and myriprequest.

`myripsniffer` uses libpcap to capture and print RIP(v1, v2, ng) packets.
Example usage: `./myripsniffer -i eth0`

`myripresponse` forges RIPng response messages
Example usage: `./myripresponse -i eth0 -r 2001:db8:0:abcd::/64`

`myriprequest` forges RIPng request messages
Example usage: TODO


To compile the program, just use the provided Makefile:
`make` will build all three executables,
`make clean` will clean all built files


This archive contains the folliwing files:
* README - this readme
* manual.pdf - which contains detailed descriptions of both RIP and the programs
* Makefile
* myriprequest.c
* myripresponse.c
* myripsniffer.c - the source code for the programs
